PLAN REQUEST

You are working inside THIS repository (React + TypeScript client, Node + Express server, Topia RTSDK integration).

Before writing any code, output a PLAN that covers:

1. **File tree delta**

   - Which new files will be created?
   - Which existing files will be modified?

2. **Endpoint signatures**

   - Method, path, query/body params, response schema.

3. **Data shapes**

   - TypeScript interfaces/types for inputs and outputs.

4. **Tests to add/modify**

   - Jest test file names.
   - Test scenarios (status, response body, SDK method calls, credentials flow).

5. **Risks/assumptions**
   - Any unclear SDK usage?
   - Any potential changes that might violate protected file constraints?

RULES TO RESPECT

- Do NOT edit: client/App.tsx, client/backendAPI.ts, client/setErrorMessage.ts, server/getCredentials.ts, server/errorHandler.ts.
- All SDK calls go through server/utils/topiaInit.ts (or sdk wrappers).
- No SDK calls directly from React.
- Responses must match schema: { success: true, data?: any } or { success: false, error: string }.
- Wrap SDK calls in try/catch â†’ return JSON or throw for errorHandler.
- Add inline comment above each SDK call citing the exact method used.
- For styling, prefer sdk-style.css classes.
- Always add/update Jest tests under server/tests/.

After you output the PLAN and I approve, then propose code diffs.
