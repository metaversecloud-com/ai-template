On the home page, user can click 1 of 6 plant images to create & drop a new DroppedAsset in the world using the clicked image URL. Upon successfully dropping the new DroppedAsset, the Visitor's data object should have an array of dropped assets and be updated to include the new `droppedAsset.id`. When a user opens the app their Visitor data object should be retrieved and their list of dropped assets should be returned to the client.
